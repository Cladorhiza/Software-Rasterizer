# Software Rasterizer
 
My attempt at making a rasterizer mainly to understand as much as possible about the graphics pipeline.
 
Features so far:
- Wireframe/filled triangles
- MVP matrix transformations
- Texture sampling
- Multithreaded fragment shading
 
Uses stb_image to load textures: https://github.com/nothings/stb
